AI assignment 1  

`python File Name:` <b>team48</b>  
`Class name:`   <b>Player48</b>


### IMPORTANT Instructions

<b>1)</b>  The naming convention for classes and files for all teams has been uploaded on moodle. Please let me know in case there is any discrepancy with your team ASAP.

<b>2)</b> You need to implement a class with the given name (e.g. Player42) in a python file with corresponding name (i.e. team42.py) Note that since this is a group assignment, only one submission needs to be made per team. Please make sure your code at least implements the 'move' function as required by the evaluator_code.py

<b>3)</b> For the purposes of the soft deadline, your code needs to AT LEAST a) Adhere to naming conventions b) Return a valid move in all cases. We would not grade your strategies at this point but would validate your code, run it against benchmarks and provide you feedback. As a reminder no code from the evaluator should be included in your submission.

<b>4)</b> Please post any questions about Naming Conventions/Code on the forum in moodle. I've already answered some FAQs there.

The soft deadline is highly recommended to make sure that your bot doesn't go down because it misses game logic or runs into a technical issue. Hope to see some great submissions!
