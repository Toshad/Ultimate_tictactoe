AI assignment 1  

`python File Name:` <b>team48</b>  
`Class name:`   <b>Player48</b>


### IMPORTANT Instructions

<b>1)</b>  The naming convention for classes and files for all teams has been uploaded on moodle. Please let me know in case there is any discrepancy with your team ASAP.

<b>2)</b> You need to implement a class with the given name (e.g. Player42) in a python file with corresponding name (i.e. team42.py) Note that since this is a group assignment, only one submission needs to be made per team. Please make sure your code at least implements the 'move' function as required by the evaluator_code.py

<b>3)</b> For the purposes of the soft deadline, your code needs to AT LEAST a) Adhere to naming conventions b) Return a valid move in all cases. We would not grade your strategies at this point but would validate your code, run it against benchmarks and provide you feedback. As a reminder no code from the evaluator should be included in your submission.

<b>4)</b> Please post any questions about Naming Conventions/Code on the forum in moodle. I've already answered some FAQs there.

The soft deadline is highly recommended to make sure that your bot doesn't go down because it misses game logic or runs into a technical issue. Hope to see some great submissions!

------------------------------------------------------------------  


<b>Please note that your code should contain just a single class with the corresponding name (Please take care of the lowercase and uppercase while naming your class and file). You should not have any global declarations or definitions. Everything needs to be inside the class. We will just import the class from your code, in the game engine, and call its move function passing the current board state, to get a valid move.</b>

------------------------------------------------------------------  

Here are answers to some common questions:

<b>1) Can we use external storage?</b>

You cannot open any other file or make system calls from your class. You may use variables inside your class itself to store data that will persist throughout a game, but not across different games.

<b>2) Can we use standard libraries?</b>

You may use the latest stable releases of standard libraries like NumPy, SymPy, Scikit-learn etc. if you'd like. If you're using a non-standard library, please contact me before doing so.

<b>3) The evaluator code doesn't compile on my machine.</b>

a) The code has been written in Python 2.7. Please make sure you have the same version.
b) The code has been developed using Linux line endings and blank spaces. It has been known to give indentation errors on some editors like Sublime Text. Please make sure you remove all such indentation errors, if you're using a different editor.
